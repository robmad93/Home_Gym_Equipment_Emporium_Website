# Home Gym Equipment Emporium

Home Gym Equipment Emporium is a responsive, front-end e-commerce website created to showcase and sell home gym equipment. The project demonstrates modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices, with a strong focus on responsive design, usability, accessibility, and performance. This was my attempt for the SD-TA-003 web development module of my Google Software Development Apprenticeship in partnership with FIT.

## Project Overview

The website simulates an online retail experience for a home gym equipment business based in Co. Clare, Ireland. Users can browse products by category, add items to a shopping cart, view a running total, and proceed to a checkout page. The site is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly across desktop and mobile screen sizes.

## Features

- Responsive navigation with hamburger menu for smaller screens  
- Hero section with call-to-action on the home page  
- Product listings organised by category using CSS Grid  
- Interactive shopping cart with add/remove functionality  
- Dynamic total price calculation using JavaScript  
- Checkout button that activates and animates when items are added  
- Image slideshow on the home page  
- Contact form with submission feedback  
- Embedded Google Maps for store locations  
- Accessible markup and descriptive alt text for images  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, animations, and styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Interactivity, shopping cart logic, and UI behaviour  
- **AVIF / JPEG images** – Optimised for performance  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  

## Responsive Design

The website uses a mobile-first approach and CSS media queries to ensure a consistent experience across devices. Layouts adapt automatically using Flexbox and CSS Grid, and navigation changes from a hamburger menu on small screens to a horizontal menu on larger displays.

## SEO & Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)  
- Descriptive page titles and headings  
- Alt text for all images  
- Responsive design to improve mobile SEO  
- Optimised image formats for faster load times  

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `home.html` in a web browser  
3. Navigate through the site using the menu  
4. Add products to the cart and interact with features  

No server or build tools are required because the project runs entirely in the browser.

## Future Improvements

- Persistent cart using `localStorage`  
- Backend integration for real checkout functionality  
- User authentication and accounts  
- Product filtering and search  
- Performance auditing and further SEO optimisation
